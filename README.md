Personal UCC Homepage with Theme Switching &amp; Currency Converter

As part of a web development assignment, I designed and built my own personal University College Cork (UCC) homepage with a focus on usability, personalisation, and functionality. The homepage features a theme-switching option, allowing users to toggle between a default light mode, an eye-friendly night mode and a high contrast theme with contradicting colours. Additionally, I implemented a currency converter tool, providing users with a seamless way to convert currencies based on real-time exchange rates. The project involved front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an emphasis on responsive design and user-friendly interactions.
